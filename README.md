# **🎓 School Performance Analysis**

### **📄 Overview**
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.

This project focuses on analyzing NYC public school SAT performance to answer three key questions:
1. 🔢 **Which NYC schools have the best math results?**
2. 🔢 **What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?**
3. 🔢 **Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?**

### **📚 Dataset**
The project uses a dataset (`schools.csv`) containing details about 375 schools, including:
- **`school_name`**: Name of the school.
- **`borough`**: The borough where the school is located (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn).
- **`building_code`**: Unique building code identifier.
- **`average_math`**: Average math score.
- **`average_reading`**: Average reading score.
- **`average_writing`**: Average writing score.
- **`percent_tested`**: Percentage of students tested.
